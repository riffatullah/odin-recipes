# odin-recipes
Hello Odin Again.

This is the html and git tutorial project. It is the fourth time I am doing this project. It took me too long to get the basic idea of how to organize the project. I have created and deleted the "odin-recipes" project during the learning process. Now that I am getting the idea, I intend not to delete it this time but to find ways around if I am in any sort of problem.
